              <h3>Why we exist</h3>
              <p>
                MyWave promotes life balance through surf and water sports. We
                want to help children, teenagers and families discover the
                strength and joy of doing water sports in nature. The power of the ocean can help you become stronger,
                happier and more balanced — a healthy alternative to endless
                hours online in front of devices.

              <h3>Who started MyWave</h3>
              <p>
                Hi! I am Arthur, 14 years old, and surfing is my passion.  I grew up just like many other kids — surrounded by screens, noise, and endless scrolling. But the first time I tried surfing, everything changed. The ocean became a place where I could feel at my best.  Surfing taught me patience, courage, how to trust myself and brought lots of new people and friends in my life. Though intense training I reached a competitive level in surf and now I travel and compete at international level and see parts of the world I never imagined I’d visit. Being out in the water beats scrolling any day.


Nature has given me so much more than any screen ever could — real joy, real adventure, real memories. I want to share that feeling with other kids and families. I want them to know that out there, beyond the phones and tablets, there is a whole world waiting. A world where you can feel the wind, hear the waves, and discover your own strength. With support from family, friends and surf community I want to launch MyWave to help you discover the beauty of surfing and other water sports. 

Surfing changed my life, maybe it can change yours too!

              <h3>What we believe</h3>
              <p>
                MyWave is here to help you discover aware outdoor water sports and
                encourage youth to live more offline and more alive. We believe
                the sea, the ocean is one of the best places to build confidence,
                friendships and real-life skills — far away from constant screens
                and notifications.
